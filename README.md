## 💡 Strategic Advice

1. *Boost Shareability for Virality*

   - *Action:* Focus on content formats that encourage sharing (short-form videos, giveaways, referral campaigns).  

2. *Channel Investment Strategy*  
   - Instagram and Facebook are safe bets with volume, but Pinterest shows *higher ROAS per dollar*.  
   - *Action:* Test increased investment in Pinterest to capture untapped ROI while maintaining strong presence on Instagram/Facebook.  

3. *Geographic Optimization*  
   - London delivers strong engagement, but Manchester shows *efficient spend-to-conversion performance*.  
   - *Action:* Allocate incremental budget to Manchester for growth while maintaining London as a brand hub.  

4. *Seasonal Campaign Planning*  
   - Fall and Summer campaigns outperform Spring.  
   - *Action:* Double down on creative formats used in Fall/Summer, and review why Spring underperformed (timing, message relevance, or budget allocation).  

5.  *Conversion Efficiency Monitoring*  
   - CPC/CTR efficiency has improved over time — showing optimization success.  
   - *Action:* Keep refining targeting and bidding strategies, especially around *Q4 (October–December)* when conversions typically spike.
